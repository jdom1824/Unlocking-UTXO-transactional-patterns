# Unlocking-UTXO-transactional-patterns


## Introduction
Blockchain technology ensures record-keeping by redundantly storing and verifying transactions on a distributed network of nodes. Permissionless blockchains have pushed the advancement of decentralized applications, characterized by distributed business logic, resilience against centralized failure, and data immutability.  However, one of the remaining open challenges in permissionless blockchains is the scalability on storage, i.e. the database's ability to grow sub-linearly in relation to the number of nodes. Due to the intrinsic redundancy in design, enhancing transactional throughput often compromises storage, as seen in projects such as Elastico, OmniLedger, and Rapidchain. On the other hand, solutions seeking to minimize storage on nodes, such as CUB, Jidar, SASLedger, and SE-Chain, lack transactional throughput.

## Objective
The primary objective of this paper is to delve deep into the UTXO and Account Models, identifying their transactional patterns. By understanding these models thoroughly, we aim to pave the way for future research to enhance storage scalability in distributed environments. Our ultimate goal is to contribute to the advancement of blockchain technology by unlocking more efficient transactional patterns.

## Key Features
- **Granular Transactional Patterns**: We introduce finer transactional patterns compared to existing solutions, allowing for more flexibility and efficiency in transaction processing.

- **Scalability Focus**: By addressing the limitations of current transactional patterns, we aim to facilitate the scalability of storage in distributed environments, enabling blockchain technology to handle larger transaction volumes effectively.

- **Research Contribution**: This project serves as a foundational study for future research endeavors aimed at optimizing transactional models in blockchain technology.
